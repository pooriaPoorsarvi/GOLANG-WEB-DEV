This Part of the introduction will be fairly short because it's much more efficient to use a front end from work and
to golangs credit it provides really good tools to use templates but its still easier to use something like angular.
also keep in mind that these codes, were used with GOLAND IDE and there for the running directory was the project directory.
that's why we have a folder only for templates.
